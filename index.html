                <p>Hello, my name is Yash Patel. I am a fifteen year old programmer from California. Since a young age, I have always enjoyed building things, a passion which began at the young age of two years old when I was introduced to Legos which quickly began a favorite pastime of mine for years. Fast forward to the present, I still have not forgotten my passion for creation although now my work is done through a different medium, programming. Since discovering the world of programming at about the age of 8, I have spent countless hours programming a variety of different types of projects and pursuing my passions in the realm of computers from building PCs to creating digital art. I can code in multiple different languages including Python, C#, Java, SQL, and JavaScript.</p>

                        <h3>Web of Death Game</h3>
                        <p>This is a video game that I made for the annual Boss Rush Game Jam. Of the 7,000 people that joined the competition and the 863 games that ended up being finished and submitted on time, my game got 86st place in art which is a considerable amount of progress from previously when I did not do as well. This game was also completed mostly under the course of one weekend as I learned about the competition very late but still wanted to participate despite it almost being over which I believe makes a testament to the progress I have made as a game developer. This game was made in the Unity Game Engine and is coded mainly using C#.</p>

                        <p>For this video game, I worked in a team of around twenty others who were developers and artists which helped me learn how to work in a team effectively and complete tasks on time. This game was also published on Steam and the names of all of the developers, including mine, are in the credits of the game. This game was also coded in C#.</p>

                    <p>In my high school's robotics team for the FIRST Robotics League, I helped program multiple subsystems for the robot including an elevator to help place objects as well as the intake subsystem which helps the robot collect items to compete in the game. These are crucial subsystems as without them, we would not be able to score any points and would immediately lose the tournament. These subsystems were coded in Java.</p>

                        <p>This search engine is very different from normal search engines as it allows users to link websites if they are missing. This is very helpful as it allows for people to get the results that they want. As I tend to check the results every week, I also make sure that the results are safe. This project was made with the Django web framework which allowed me to code the backend in python.</p>

Using JavaScript, I was able to make it in the form of a website and I used this project to understand how apis work better.</p>

                        <p>Alongside my experience in programming, I also went down the rabbit hole of building computers at around the same time. I have built multiple PCs for my family and my friends and this one is one of the best ones I have made and also the first PC I ever built.</p>

I helped program a large portion of the watch and I also contributed to the building process by designing a model for a shell to protect the electronics of the watch and by connecting the display and the Arduino that powered it. </p>
